THIS TIME ITS DIFFERENT
I'm gonna make it.

Fight
Fight!
FUCKING FIGHT!!

Im a survivor, I'm gonna make it
You are filled with DETERMINATION.
Im not moving an inch

You think I'm gonna back down?
You better think again.
I've always said:
The bigger they are,
The harder they fall.
Hit me, I'll hit you harder.
STRIKE BACK.
Fight Back.

Believe me, you've never met a motherfucker like me.
I'm rising up, I've had enough
I'm alive, take a look into my eyes
I'm invincible tonight

Resist and bite

-You're never gonna make it,
-You're not good enough,
-You really think you're different?
-Man, you must be kidding,
-Think you're gonna hit it?
-But you just don't get it,
-Its impossible.
-Its not probable.
-You are're irresponsible.
-Too many obstacles.
-You gotta stop it yo,
-You gotta take it slow,
-Don't waste your time no more.
+Who the FUCK are you to tell me what to do?
+I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove,
+I'm gonna make my move.
+I'm gonna make it soon.
+And I'll do it 'cause it's what I wanna FUCKING DO.
